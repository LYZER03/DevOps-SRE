<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This lab aims to introduce the principles and practices of DevOps, with an emphasis on the CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure as code. Throughout the semester, students have explored various aspects of DevOps, including Git version control, containerization with Docker, automated testing with Jenkins, and infrastructure provisioning with Terraform.

### Some highlights of the lab activities include:

- devops-introduction
- scm
- continuous-testing
- ci-cd
- infrustructure-as-code
- docker-containers
- container-orchestration
- storage-in-kubernetes
- cloud-native
- monitoring

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In addition to these lab activities, students have also been assigned a DevOps project, where they apply the concepts and tools they've learned throughout the semester. The project is a simulated real-world scenario, requiring students to collaborate, solve complex problems, and deliver value to their clients.

## Course Feedback

In general, our courses aim to provide a practical and pragmatic introduction to application development. The program follows a logical sequence, favoring a fluid learning trajectory for students. We particularly appreciate the seamless integration of key tools such as GitHub CI/CD, Docker, Vagrant, Kubernetes and istio. This integration significantly streamlines the management of the various processes essential to building a complete application, encompassing deployment, containerization and environment configuration.

To maximize the benefits of this course, we recommend that students possess a fundamental understanding of web programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JS. Some advanced topics, including DevOps practices, continuous integration, Docker, Infrastructure as Code, Istio and Kubernetes, are introduced, although we recognize that these can be covered at a rapid pace. Those with no prior knowledge in these areas may find it difficult to keep up with the accelerated progression of the course.
