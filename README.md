<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This lab aims to introduce the principles and practices of DevOps, with an emphasis on the CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure as code. Throughout the semester, students have explored various aspects of DevOps, including Git version control, containerization with Docker, automated testing with Jenkins, and infrastructure provisioning with Terraform.

### Some highlights of the lab activities include:

- devops-introduction
- scm
- continuous-testing
- ci-cd
- infrustructure-as-code
- docker-containers
- container-orchestration
- storage-in-kubernetes
- cloud-native
- monitoring

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In addition to these lab activities, students have also been assigned a DevOps project, where they apply the concepts and tools they've learned throughout the semester. The project is a simulated real-world scenario, requiring students to collaborate, solve complex problems, and deliver value to their clients.

# Miscellaneous

## Course Feedback

In general, we believe the classes provide a highly practical introduction to application development. The course content is sequential, which facilitates our learning progress as students. What we enjoyed the most was the integration of Github CI/CD and Docker, as this platform simplifies the management of various processes when creating a complete web page, such as deployment, containerization, and environment setup.

We believe it's important for students to have a minimum level of web programming knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JS before taking this course. Some topics, like DevOps practices, Continuous Integration, or Docker, are covered more superficially, and individuals without prior knowledge might feel overwhelmed trying to keep up with the class pace.
